This project implements a command-line library management system using Python's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It allows users to manage books, users, and authors within a library.
Features:
 * Book Management:
   * Add new books with title, author, genre, and publication date.
   * Borrow books by users (marks book as unavailable).
   * Return borrowed books (marks book as available).
   * Search for books by title.
   * Display a list of all books with their availability status.
 * User Management:
   * Add new users with name and library ID.
   * View user details including borrowed books.
   * Display a list of all users.
 * Author Management:
   * Add new authors with name and biography.
   * View author details.
   * Display a list of all authors.
Running the Application:
 * Prerequisites: Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system. You can check by running python3 --version in your terminal.
 * Download the Code: Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
 * Run the Script: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the Python script (e.g., library_management.py).
 * Execute the Script: Run the script using the following command:

python library_management.py

 * Interact with the System: The application will start and present a menu with options for managing books, users, and authors. Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the system.
Using the Menu:
The main menu offers choices for:
 * Book Operations: Manage books (add, borrow, return, search, display).
 * User Operations: Manage users (add, view details, display all).

Each sub-menu provides specific options for the chosen category (books, users, authors).
